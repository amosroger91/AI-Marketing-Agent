Subject: Security Alert for West Side Transmission Website

Hi Team,

I was reviewing your website at westsidetransmission.com and noticed something important: your WordPress site is running recent version, which has Yes vulnerable plugins that are actively being exploited by hackers.

This puts your customer data, business reputation, and bottom line at risk.

I help local businesses like West Side Transmission secure their WordPress sites against these threats. Most of my clients are shocked to learn how easily these vulnerabilities can be exploited - and how simple the fixes are.

A few key points:
• Your site detected: nginx
• WordPress version: recent version
• Vulnerable plugins: Yes
• Security headers: missing

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call this week to discuss how to protect West Side Transmission? No sales pitch - just honest security advice.
