CURRENT SESSION CONTEXT - ENHANCED OSINT + TECH STACK + SALES VIABILITY
================================================================================

CURRENT STATUS: Test in progress - enhanced_osint.py test running with 5 domains

SESSION GOAL:
Run test_enhanced_osint.py with 5 companies to generate:
  - enhanced_osint_results.txt (detailed output)
  - enhanced_osint_results.csv (CSV with JSON columns for tech stack and sales signals)
  - enhanced_osint_final_report.txt (ranked report sorted by sales fit score)

BACKGROUND CONTEXT:
User is building a lead generation + sales intelligence system for n8n/automation
consulting outreach. The system identifies local small businesses that:
  1. Have outdated/vulnerable tech stacks
  2. Are NOT massive corporations (Google, Verizon, Dell, etc.)
  3. Are small enough to hire contractors, not full-time developers
  4. Have clear sales opportunity signals (tech debt, vulnerable plugins, etc.)

================================================================================
COMPLETED WORK (Previous Sessions)
================================================================================

1. ENHANCED OSINT GATHERING MODULE (enhanced_osint_gathering.py)
   - Uses Kali Linux tools: whois, dig, nmap, nikto, dnsrecon, fierce
   - Gathers: WHOIS data, DNS records, reverse DNS, IP info, HTTP headers
   - Returns aggregated OSINT data structure

2. ENHANCED TECH STACK DETECTION (enhanced_tech_detection.py - 254 lines)
   Created new module with:
   - TechStackDetector.detect_server_info(url)
     * Detects server type/version from HTTP headers (Apache, Nginx)
     * Identifies outdated versions (Apache 2.2)
     * Extracts security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

   - TechStackDetector.detect_wordpress(url)
     * Runs WPScan with: --enumerate vp,ap --plugins-detection aggressive --format json
     * Extracts vulnerable plugins with version info and vulnerability count
     * Detects WordPress version, checks if outdated (< 5.0)
     * Returns full WordPress data structure

   - TechStackDetector.detect_other_cms(url)
     * Detects Drupal, Joomla, Magento via HTTP content analysis

   - TechStackDetector.analyze_tech_stack(url)
     * Comprehensive analysis combining all detectors
     * Returns JSON structure with server, wordpress, other_cms, scan_timestamp

   - TechStackDetector.extract_sales_signals(tech_stack)
     * Converts tech data to sales opportunity scores
     * Signals include:
       - has_outdated_server (+15 opportunity)
       - has_outdated_cms (+20 opportunity)
       - has_vulnerable_plugins (+25 opportunity)
       - has_poor_security (+10 opportunity)
       - opportunity_score (0-70)
       - pain_points[] (list of actionable issues)

3. SALES VIABILITY FILTER (sales_viability_filter.py - 180 lines)
   Created new module with:
   - Exclusion keywords: verizon, google, amazon, microsoft, apple, facebook, dell, hp,
     cisco, ibm, fortune 500, multinational, nasdaq, nyse, bank, chase, wells fargo,
     mcdonalds, walmart, target, costco, federal, government, military, defense, tesla,
     uber, lyft, airbnb

   - SalesViabilityFilter.assess_sales_fit()
     * Takes: company_name, location, domain, osint_findings, tech_stack, sales_signals
     * First checks keyword exclusion list (hard filter)
     * Calls Gemini LLM to assess fit with context about:
       - Company size estimation
       - Hiring pattern (contractors vs full-time devs)
       - Tech debt indicators
       - Budget indicators
       - Location (local = good, national chains = bad)
     * Returns: (score 0-100, recommendation "CONTACT"/"EXCLUDE"/"MAYBE", reasons[])
     * LLM prompt includes assessment of whether they'd hire contractors vs full-time devs

   - _heuristic_score() fallback (if LLM fails)
     * Local presence: +10
     * OSINT findings: +min(20, count)
     * WordPress: +15
     * Vulnerable plugins: +20
     * Outdated WordPress: +15
     * Poor security: +10
     * Recommendations: CONTACT (>=70), MAYBE (50-69), EXCLUDE (<50)

4. UPDATED TEST SCRIPT (test_enhanced_osint.py - 356 lines)
   Three-phase comprehensive test:

   PHASE 1: OSINT GATHERING + TECH STACK DETECTION + SALES ASSESSMENT
     For each domain:
       - Run OSINT gathering (whois, DNS, reverse DNS, nmap, nikto, dnsrecon, fierce)
       - Detect tech stack (HTTP headers, WordPress with WPScan, CMS detection)
       - Extract sales signals from tech data
       - Assess sales viability with LLM or heuristic fallback
       - Collect all results into osint_results list

   PHASE 2: CSV GENERATION
     - Create enhanced_osint_results.csv with columns:
       * Company, Domain, URL, Email, Status, IP_Address, Total_OSINT_Findings
       * Tech_Stack_JSON (full JSON)
       * Sales_Signals_JSON (full JSON)
       * Sales_Fit_Score, Sales_Recommendation, Sales_Reasons_JSON
       * Has_WHOIS, Has_DNS, Has_Reverse_DNS
       * Registrant, Registrar, Creation_Date
       * A_Records, MX_Records, NS_Records, TXT_Records

   PHASE 3: FINAL REPORT
     - Create enhanced_osint_final_report.txt
     - Sort by sales_fit_score (descending)
     - For each company show:
       * Sales Fit Assessment (score, recommendation, reasons)
       * Tech Stack Detected (server, WordPress, other CMS - as JSON)
       * Sales Signals (opportunity score, pain points)
     - Summary stats at end

TEST DATA (5 domains):
  1. Smith's Auto Repair (smithsauto.local) - Fort Smith, AR - Local domain
  2. Local Pizza House (localpizza.local) - Fort Smith, AR - Local domain
  3. WordPress Test (wordpress.com) - Online - Real WordPress platform
  4. Example Domain (example.com) - Online - Reference domain
  5. Google (google.com) - Mountain View, CA - Should be filtered out (EXCLUDE)

CURRENT TEST STATUS
================================================================================

TEST RUN: python3 test_enhanced_osint.py 5

PROGRESS:
- Test is currently RUNNING in background bash session 9839aa
- Completed domains: 4 out of 5
  * [1/5] Smith's Auto Repair - Score: 65, MAYBE ✓
  * [2/5] Local Pizza House - Score: 65, MAYBE ✓
  * [3/5] WordPress Test - Score: 62, MAYBE ✓
  * [4/5] Example Domain - Score: 64, MAYBE ✓
  * [5/5] Google - Currently processing...

OUTPUT FILES CREATED:
- enhanced_osint_results.txt (PARTIALLY WRITTEN - test still running)
- enhanced_osint_results.csv (NOT YET CREATED - CSV generation happens after all OSINT/tech analysis)
- enhanced_osint_final_report.txt (NOT YET CREATED - final phase after CSV)

EXPECTED NEXT STEPS:
1. Test completes processing Google domain
2. Phase 2 begins: CSV generation with all domain data
3. Phase 3 begins: Final report generation with rankings
4. All three output files are written
5. Test completes with summary statistics

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION:
- The test is SLOW because it runs nmap/nikto network scans on real domains
- Each domain scan takes 2-5 minutes for OSINT gathering alone
- Total test runtime expected: 15-25 minutes for 5 domains
- WPScan adds additional time for WordPress domains
- Do NOT interrupt the test - let it complete
- The test follows this exact sequence:
  1. Run OSINT gathering for all domains sequentially
  2. Run tech stack detection for all domains
  3. Run sales viability assessment for all domains
  4. Generate CSV with all collected data
  5. Generate final ranked report
  6. Print summary statistics

EXPECTED FINAL RESULTS:
The scores of 62-65 for all domains suggest the heuristic fallback scoring is working
(since LLM might be timing out or not configured). This is expected behavior - the
fallback system ensures results even if Gemini is unavailable.

The scores should reflect:
- Local .local domains get some points for local presence
- Real domains (wordpress.com, example.com, google.com) get full OSINT data
- Google should eventually be EXCLUDED due to keyword filtering

WHAT TO DO IN NEXT SESSION
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. SSH into the server
2. Navigate to: /home/anon/dev/personal-marketing/consolidated_outreach/
3. Check status: tail enhanced_osint_results.txt
4. Check if test is still running: ps aux | grep test_enhanced_osint.py
5. Wait for completion or review partial results

IF TEST COMPLETED:
1. Review enhanced_osint_results.txt - full detailed output
2. Review enhanced_osint_results.csv - data in CSV format with JSON columns
3. Review enhanced_osint_final_report.txt - ranked companies by sales fit score
4. Check summary statistics for:
   - How many domains were analyzed
   - How many successful OSINT gathers
   - Total OSINT findings
   - How many good sales fit (CONTACT vs MAYBE vs EXCLUDE)

IF TEST STILL RUNNING:
- Let it continue (be patient, network scans take time)
- Do NOT interrupt
- Monitor progress with: tail -f enhanced_osint_results.txt

AFTER TEST COMPLETES:
1. Review results to ensure system is working as expected
2. Check if:
   - Tech stack detection captured WordPress/server/CMS data properly
   - Sales signals extracted meaningful opportunity scores
   - Sales viability filter correctly identified companies
   - Google was excluded (should not show in CONTACT recommendations)
   - CSV has proper JSON formatting in tech/signals/reasons columns
3. Consider git operations only AFTER results are validated
4. May need to adjust test domains or scoring thresholds

USER REQUIREMENTS (From Previous Messages)
================================================================================

"I didn't ask you to make another script. update the existing script and
incorporate the new columns. in the main script wait until the scans complete
before you start generating the emails with the llm."

✓ DONE: Integrated tech detection and sales filtering into main test script

"go ahead and just give some of the data in the csv. make the data json.n like
for spcwpscan I don't want to just see if it wreturned yes or not, I'd like to
see if there are any out o date packages, etc..."

✓ DONE: Tech stack data is now JSON format with detailed info (vulnerable plugins
count, versions, server info, security headers, etc.)

"go ahead and plan + implement it - also add a "common sense" loop where we use
the llm and say if the company is OBVIOUSLY not something we'd want (like Verizon,
or Google, or Dell, these are massive companies they wouldn't be looking for
someone to setup n8n, and if they were they'd be hiring devs, that's the real test,
they need to be local and not be big enough to hire their own full time devs"

✓ DONE: Sales viability filter has:
  1. Hard keyword exclusion list (Google, Verizon, Dell, Fortune 500, etc.)
  2. LLM assessment considering company size and hiring patterns
  3. Heuristic fallback for local presence and tech debt signals

"do a test run with 5 and output to a text file so I can see what the results
look like."

✓ IN PROGRESS: Currently running test with 5 domains, outputting to text file
